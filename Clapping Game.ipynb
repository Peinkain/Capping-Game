    "# Clapping Game\n",

    "A while ago, I was chatting with my friends at Phineas Bar at UCL. After couple of hours talking, there was a suggestion for a drinking game which required swift reaction time skills. As I do not possess those, I decided to master this game with a slightly different approach. I hope that anyone struggling as I did will find this code useful and possibly joyful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of the Clapping Game** <br>\n",
    "As every drinking game, this one has also very simple rules. Create a circle with a group of friends. The first player chooses any integer. (Choose direction either clock-wise or counter clock-wise). The next person must say the following number if it doesn't contain 3,6 or 9. If it does contain one of these numbers, the player must clap his hands instead. Thus, the number is basically skipped and it's next person's turn. If these numbers appear more than once in the following integer (e.g 36), then the player must clap as many times as the numbers appear in the integer (in this example case it would be twice).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries ##\n",
    "For this game, we don't do any further analysis. Thus, simple NumPy will be sufficient for all numerical calcualtions."
